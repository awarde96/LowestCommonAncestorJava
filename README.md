# LowestCommonAncestorJava
Implementation of Lowest Common Ancestor on a binary tree in java with unit testing.

I used a method of code a little test a little, where I would code a funtion that I wished to implement and would then add 
unit tests to confirm that is was functioning as I had intended.

The unit testing framework that I was using was JUnit.
